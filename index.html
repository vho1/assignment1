		<h2>Welcome to a Study on Computer Menus!</h2>
		<h5>Assignment for a Course on Human Computer Interaction at NUS</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Hi! Welcome! Today, most menus you see on the computer are of the linear type (see below for description). This experiment is to test two unconventional menu types that you may or may not be familiar with: the Marking and Radial Menus (see below for description). The experiment will ask you to select specified items using the two menu types. The research question is to compare performance measure of speed and efficiency for the two menu types. </p>
		<p><b>Goal of the Study:</b> To study and compare the usability of Marking versus Radial menus</p>
		<p><b>Experiment Instructions:</b></p>
		<ol>
			<li>There will be a questionnare before and after the experiment and each is expected to last roughly 5 minutes</li>
			<li>You will be provided with a participant ID - use it for this application and in the pre- and post-experiment questionnaires</li>
			<li>During the experiment, you will be asked to select items using the Marking menu or Radial menu</li>
			<li>There will be a total of 10 trials under different conditions</li>
			<li>Please feel free to take a 5 minute break if necessary</li>
			<li>The experiment itself will take about 10 minutes not including the break</li>
		</ol>
